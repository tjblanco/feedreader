# Feed Reader Testing

## Project Overview

In this project you are given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The original developer of this application clearly saw the value in testing, they've already included [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) and even started writing their first test suite! Unfortunately, they decided to move on to start their own company and we're now left with an application with an incomplete test suite. That's where you come in.

## Dependencies

The following dependencies are required in this project:

* [JQuery](https://jquery.com/)
* [Roboto font](http://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Roboto:400,100,300,700)
* [Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/index.html)

## Getting started

Please, clone or download the project in your computer and open the ```index.html``` file in your 
favourite browser. 

````git clone https://github.com/tjblanco/feedreader.git````

The following tests should be passed to successfully run the application:

* All feeds are defined and they include an url and a name
* The feed menu is hidden by default
* The feed menu is displayed/hidden when the hamburger icon is clicked
* The feed items are updated accordingly
